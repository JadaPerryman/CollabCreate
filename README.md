# CollaCreate
Senior Capstone 2022

Final project is on the master branch!

This is my senior project for Adelphi University. It is a drawing web application where multiple users can draw on the canvas at a time.
Its functionality includes drawing using mouse drag, changing the stroke color, changing the stroke size, and saving your work by right clicking on the canvas.
The functions to change the tool shape and clear the canvas are still a work in progress.
